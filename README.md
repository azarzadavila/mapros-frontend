# MaProS
This project is the implementation of work from my Master thesis at UCLouvain.
This is still work in progress and is not a final version of the work.
The main goal is to show a proof of concept of a system that would allow a user to write a mathematical proof in a
close to natural language manner.
Such proof would then be translated in [Lean3](https://leanprover.github.io/) to be verified.

This repository contains the frontend part of the system.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Instructions are available for
* Installation : [installation.md](installation.md)
* User Guide : [user_guide.md](user_guide.md)

## External sources
* The proof for the sandiwch theorem available at this [link](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/docs/lean/sandwich.html)
  is used for testing.   
* The project [react-mathquill](https://github.com/viktorstrate/react-mathquill) is used to render math formulas.
* [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) framework is used.
