# Installation guide
This installation guide explains how to install and launch the system.
It is divised between a backend and frontend server.
## Backend
Specific on how to install the frontend are available at the frontend [repository](https://github.com/azarzadavila/mapros/blob/main/installation.md).
## Frontend
The only dependencies to run the server are Node >= 10.16 and npm >= 5.6.
One can then install the node modules by :
`npm install`
To start the server simply do :
`npm start`

The url for the backend server is set in *Constants.js*. 
Usually if the backend server is set locally then the url is http://localhost:8000/.
